In this chapter, we learn how to train the model and eventually load the OpenAI weights.\n\nI have structured this post a bit differently than the book; applying a machine learning perspective helped me see patterns that made a new layout feel more intuitive. Although I’m using GPT-2 as the primary example, this structure holds up for other models as well.\n\n---\n\n# The Structure of Training a Deep Learning Model\n\nLet's start by defining the structure:\n\n* You need a **training loop** to iterate over the data multiple times. These are called **epochs**, where 1 epoch means 1 whole pass at the data.\n* We iterate over **batches**, which are small splits of the data. A batch in one epoch may not be the same as the batch in another (if we shuffle), but the batch will always have the same shape.\n* **Reset gradients:** Before we calculate the loss for each batch, we need to reset the loss gradients from the previous batch iteration.\n* **Forward pass** to calculate loss for the batch.\n* **Backward pass** to calculate loss gradients.\n* **Update model weights** using those gradients.\n* Check training and validation losses.\n\n---\n\n## There are some obvious questions here:\n\n**Q: How do we define training and validation set?**\n**A:** We define training and validation sets using a single split. It's important to note that the validation set is **not** the training set—the model never learns from it directly. The reason I mention this distinction is that we do not re-sample the validation set over and over again; it stays static. Think of the validation set as a \"hold-out\" exam that you do not feed the model during the training of weights.\n\n**Q: How do we calculate loss?**\n**A:** We use a metric called **Cross Entropy Loss**. This is the same metric we use for calculating the batch loss during optimization. However, the metrics we use to *judge* performance might be different. In an ML model, we need a \"math heavy\" loss metric (something smooth that we can calculate gradients over) when we are optimizing our algorithm, and an \"intuitive\" metric (like Accuracy) when we are just measuring performance. Think about Cross Entropy loss as the engine for optimization, while things like F1-Score or Accuracy are the dashboard gauges—they are great for humans to read, but not suitable for calculating gradients.\n\n**Q: What is Cross Entropy Loss?**\n**A:** Cross Entropy Loss is a way to calculate the difference between two probability distributions. Technically, it is measured as the negative logarithm of the predicted probability for the correct class. In simpler terms, if the model predicts a low probability for the actual answer, the Cross Entropy loss shoots up high.\n\n**Q: If this is supervised learning, what is the $y$ variable?**\n**A:** The  variable is the token sequence shifted by 1. Think of this like a forecasting problem: we have a $y$ variable (the target) that we are trying to predict, which leads our current input value by 1 step. This is often called \"Next Token Prediction.\" With each new token predicted, we append this new token to our sequence to generate the next one.\n\nEnough talk, let's build this structure step by step.\n\n# Implementing the training loop for GPT\n\nThis is going to be a step by step process, where we start with the inner most loop and then add batch and epochs:\n- Defining Training & Valdiation Sets\n- Defining the $X$ and $y$ variables\n- Defining Cross-Entropy loss\n- Create a loop for batches with loss\n- Create a loop for epoch\n\nWe should define a few constants which we are going to use across our model training. This is similar to the config file we had defined in the previous Chapter except the context length is significantly shorter. Larger Context length implies shorter memory requirements.\n\n::: {#195cd558 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport torch\nfrom gpt import GPTModel\n\nGPT_CONFIG_124M = {\n

In the greedy approach(generate_text_simple) we sample the token with the highest probability. To generate text with more variety, we replace argmax with a function that samples from a probability distribution.\n\nIllustrating this below to reduce the fluff. We start with a dictionary and its reverse map.\n\nWe introduce a next_token_logits which we assume is the logits output from the GPT2 model for \"every effort moves you\".

a machine apart to see exactly how the gears mesh. However, you're right; the draft is a bit heavy on the \"meta\" commentary about your process.\n\nTo keep it snappy and maintain your **practitioner-focused tone**, we can condense your intent into three high-leverage focus areas. This frames your next steps as a targeted investigation rather than a long to-do list.\n\nHere is a tighter version of your closing:\n\n---\n\n# Final Thoughts: Closing the Loop\n\nIn this chapter, we moved from the architecture of a GPT model to a functional training pipeline. We’ve seen how the  variable (the target) is simply the input shifted by one, and how a few lines of decoding logic can turn raw probability into something that resembles human speech.\n\nHowever, seeing the code run is only half the battle. To truly understand the \"why\" behind the \"how,\" I’m taking a temporary step back from the book to perform a **\"Backward Walk\"**—tracing the pipeline from the training loop all the way back to the tokenizer. My goal is to bridge the gap between foundational theory and the modern reality of LLM development.\n\nHere are the three things I am focusing on next:\n\n## 1. The Hardware Reality (Compute & FLOPs)\n\nTraining isn’t just about logic; it’s about physics. I want to calculate the **FLOPs (Floating Point Operations)** required for a training run and understand how hardware constraints—like VRAM and memory bandwidth—dictate the design of the training loop.\n\n## 2. Scaling Laws & Parameter Math\n\nThe relationship between model size (parameters) and dataset size (tokens) isn't arbitrary. I want to explore the **mathematical scaling laws** that determine whether a model is \"compute-optimal\" and how these ratios have shifted from the original GPT-2 days to the modern reasoning models of today.\n\n## 3. The \"Closed-Loop\" Audit\n\nBecause this model is small enough to be transparent, I want to track a single batch of data from the **tokenizer's sub-word embeddings** through the **attention layers** to the **final logits**. Mapping the exact transformation of parameters at each step will help formalize my intuition before moving on to more complex architectures.\n\nBy deconstructing the pipeline from the inside out, I’m not just learning to build a model—I’m learning to optimize the engine.\n\n",
