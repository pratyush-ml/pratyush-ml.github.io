    "text": "It is 2025, AI which can match humans is surely upon us. Every day we have breakthroughs in AI which would put careers to end.\nProbably the first to go out the window would be Software Engineers. Probably is a key word here! I don’t want Software Engineers automated. But hey Engineering in all forms has always been a cost centre for the business. And when the factory workers were being automated by assembly line noone considered their feelings. Also the fooling around with three instances of Dev, QA, Prod and making databases and selling them as a Gold Pill for businesses(SalesForce) was probably not the right move.\nThese models or atleast the genesis of these models was based on the entirety of Internet data. Noone cared about the Copyright data and Terms of Service. Data from Reddit which was at one time the Front Page of the Internet was used. (It isn’t now, it is mostly a porn website too scared of Wallstreet to call it one.) At the time of writing, one of the leaders of AI movement Open AI is claiming that a more cost effective model originating from China was trained on Open AI’s outputs. That is not very open is it?\nIf a machine can generate text with pretty much the same intent as me, the text by itself would not matter. Instead I matter and ergo the content I put out there matters.\nBefore I go on ranting about why Blogging is amazing, I want to put one thought upfront. I do not support the argument of writing makes you think better. I think it just is. I will write more about this and it could be writings for another blog.\nI want to write because I feel it can connect me with people who share similar interests as mine. There are faster means out there. I prefer blogging. I should ahve started blogging a decade earlier because I was convinced. But my inherent laziness I have found a way to do this for 10 years. 10 years is 3653 days. I feel like an idiot.\nAt the begining, it was shame guilt fear of failure. What if I could not write perfectly? What if my words do not resonate the intended audience? Later it was business and then followed by more guilt of why did I not do this before.\nI would not drive more into why I did not to do ti? Why now? There is plenty of writings for going forward.\nI want to write about my learings in the week. I read a lot of mathematics papers. I try to code most of the papers but at the end of the year it always feels like I have done nothing. I also undertake multiple courses. None of that is documented anyhwere.\nAll of what I am writing doing and documenting is going to be redundant because of AI. But this blog should continue regardless.\nTo document what I was. To be a person who could be reached out to. To show what the World means to me. For I cannot claim to be a champion of this world yet!"

    "text": "Hi! Welcome to my blog. I am Pratyush Sinha from India. I have been working in Tech for the last 10 years. First as a Trainee Decision Scientist(Very Glorified SAS programmer) and now as a Decision Science Consultant(Not glorified enough Machine Learning Engineer). In the career spanning over a decade, I have had a chance to work SAS, Python, C++, and a fair bit of VBA. I do not claim to be an expert in any of these languages but I think I can reason through most codebases thrown at me. I have worked with Forecasting algorithms a lot, NLP and more recently LLMs.\nI currently spend a lot of my day in meetings trying to understand and build solutions our clients have need.\nAside from work, I mostly spend my time with my family and reading. Whatever remains of the day is consumed by Liverpool Football Club.\nThe idea behind this blog is very simple - Share a lot of my learnings and hopefully meet people who have similar interests."

    "text": "I have been away lately. Having a new born is not easy. My wife* had a baby last year :-) and the first 6 months were really demanding for her. Maternity leave was an easy time to visit our parents for long stretches of time.\nWe shifted from Gurgaon to Patna for a couple of months and then to Hazaribagh,my wife’s hometown, later. The last week was our last week in Hazaribagh.\nHazaribagh, as a town is a very quiet place to live in. Actually every place is a quiet to live in considering my lifestyle of not participating in other people’s lives. Hazaribagh was a hill station once or may it be still is. The recent rise in temperature has shown that hill stations are not hill stations any more. It does not have too many attractions per se and that may have helped preserve its beauty. It has a hill, a very big lake with numerous smaller ones adjacent to it, and is blessed with lush greenery. The clear winner among the three was the lake. It is huge in size and can be captivating in sunsets. It nestles a lot of birds who keep on chirping.\nA few more thoughts which popped:\n\nI used to think Diversity hirings were not fair. But then again life itself is not fair. I will borrow from the wisdom of people who are wiser than me. I saw 4 women change the course of their lives becacuse of their family. It made me think whether life was really worth it.\nTeam management is a tough. People find reasons to not be accountable. Everyday there is a new issue and trust as a manager cannot be given. It needs to be earnt.\nHaving smaller routines is probably a good idea. I basically put all these points as notes on Whatsapp and have fleshed out the ideas more here.\nThe difference between great and best is the ability to go through the same thing again and again without getting bored. That is how you gain perfection.\n\nThings I think I could write a blog about: 1. Indian healthcare system is following the same trajectory as the US. May be documentign what is about to come would be a good idea 2. Document all agents we have seen recently especially from Adobe & SalesForce. 3. Document all the blogs that I read in the last week\n*Before you think this not to be right words I would like you to consider a few ablations that I had tried. When I said - My wife and I had a baby, my MD asked what my contribution to the baby was. To be honest, my contribution does not compare ,much to hers but I was there. Anyways, I have come to these choice of words because it works if I say it with a smile."
