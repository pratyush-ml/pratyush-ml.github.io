    "text": "It is 2025, AI which can match humans is surely upon us. Every day we have breakthroughs in AI which would put careers to end.\nProbably the first to go out the window would be Software Engineers. Probably is a key word here! I don’t want Software Engineers automated. But hey Engineering in all forms has always been a cost centre for the business. And when the factory workers were being automated by assembly line noone considered their feelings. Also the fooling around with three instances of Dev, QA, Prod and making databases and selling them as a Gold Pill for businesses(SalesForce) was probably not the right move.\nThese models or atleast the genesis of these models was based on the entirety of Internet data. Noone cared about the Copyright data and Terms of Service. Data from Reddit which was at one time the Front Page of the Internet was used. (It isn’t now, it is mostly a porn website too scared of Wallstreet to call it one.) At the time of writing, one of the leaders of AI movement Open AI is claiming that a more cost effective model originating from China was trained on Open AI’s outputs. That is not very open is it?\nIf a machine can generate text with pretty much the same intent as me, the text by itself would not matter. Instead I matter and ergo the content I put out there matters.\nBefore I go on ranting about why Blogging is amazing, I want to put one thought upfront. I do not support the argument of writing makes you think better. I think it just is. I will write more about this and it could be writings for another blog.\nI want to write because I feel it can connect me with people who share similar interests as mine. There are faster means out there. I prefer blogging. I should ahve started blogging a decade earlier because I was convinced. But my inherent laziness I have found a way to do this for 10 years. 10 years is 3653 days. I feel like an idiot.\nAt the begining, it was shame guilt fear of failure. What if I could not write perfectly? What if my words do not resonate the intended audience? Later it was business and then followed by more guilt of why did I not do this before.\nI would not drive more into why I did not to do ti? Why now? There is plenty of writings for going forward.\nI want to write about my learings in the week. I read a lot of mathematics papers. I try to code most of the papers but at the end of the year it always feels like I have done nothing. I also undertake multiple courses. None of that is documented anyhwere.\nAll of what I am writing doing and documenting is going to be redundant because of AI. But this blog should continue regardless.\nTo document what I was. To be a person who could be reached out to. To show what the World means to me. For I cannot claim to be a champion of this world yet!"

    "text": "I have been away lately. Having a new born is not easy. My wife* had a baby last year :-) and the first 6 months were really demanding for her. Maternity leave was an easy time to visit our parents for long stretches of time.\nWe shifted from Gurgaon to Patna for a couple of months and then to Hazaribagh,my wife’s hometown, later. The last week was our last week in Hazaribagh.\nHazaribagh, as a town is a very quiet place to live in. Actually every place is a quiet to live in considering my lifestyle of not participating in other people’s lives. Hazaribagh was a hill station once or may it be still is. The recent rise in temperature has shown that hill stations are not hill stations any more. It does not have too many attractions per se and that may have helped preserve its beauty. It has a hill, a very big lake with numerous smaller ones adjacent to it, and is blessed with lush greenery. The clear winner among the three was the lake. It is huge in size and can be captivating in sunsets. It nestles a lot of birds who keep on chirping.\nA few more thoughts which popped:\n\nI used to think Diversity hirings were not fair. But then again life itself is not fair. I will borrow from the wisdom of people who are wiser than me. I saw 4 women change the course of their lives becacuse of their family. It made me think whether life was really worth it.\nTeam management is a tough. People find reasons to not be accountable. Everyday there is a new issue and trust as a manager cannot be given. It needs to be earnt.\nHaving smaller routines is probably a good idea. I basically put all these points as notes on Whatsapp and have fleshed out the ideas more here.\nThe difference between great and best is the ability to go through the same thing again and again without getting bored. That is how you gain perfection.\n\nThings I think I could write a blog about: 1. Indian healthcare system is following the same trajectory as the US. May be documentign what is about to come would be a good idea 2. Document all agents we have seen recently especially from Adobe & SalesForce. 3. Document all the blogs that I read in the last week\n*Before you think this not to be right words I would like you to consider a few ablations that I had tried. When I said - My wife and I had a baby, my MD asked what my contribution to the baby was. To be honest, my contribution does not compare ,much to hers but I was there. Anyways, I have come to these choice of words because it works if I say it with a smile."

    "text": "My father has had two major surgeries in the neck at the Indian Spinal Injury Center, and both have been successful. But this post isn’t just about that. I want this post to give you hope that there is a hospital which could really help you in case you suffer from a spine injury. The world does not turn into a bleak place. Please treat this as a general playbook from one family to another, not as medical advice. Anything I mention that sounds like medical advice here should be discussed with your own doctors."

    "text": "The main leverage is time\nTime is of the essence when dealing with spinal injuries. The progression of these injuries is rapid and can lead to significant deterioration within a short period, often no more than 10 days to reach a critical stage. Spinal injuries follow an almost exponential curve of decline if not addressed promptly.\nInitial symptoms may include a loss of balance, followed by numbness in the fingers and legs. This can then progress to a lack of coordination in the legs, causing a limping gait. In advanced stages, individuals may lose motor functions and control over bladder and bowel movements, leading to a profound loss of confidence. My father experienced this severe stage during his first spinal injury.\nFortunately, we were able to intervene earlier during his second injury. It is crucial to understand that this deterioration can occur within 1 to 3 days. A fall can significantly accelerate this process. Therefore, it is vital not to underestimate the severity of these injuries and to prevent misdiagnosis. My father’s initial symptoms were mistakenly attributed to diabetes."

    "text": "We are in the same boat you and I\nIndian Healthcare for all its pros and cons is working like an engine. There are great hospitals near Delhi which are semi private. ISIC is one of them. You could go to AIMS for spinal injuries. But I would suggest against that. The reason is the backlog that AIMS has. No doubt, AIMS is the most affordable. It has probably the best doctors from India. But I think ISIC does a reasonable job of maintaining the balance between cost and good service. I don’t want to delve into past laurels because they are pretty much useless when it comes to the present day running of the hospital but ISIC runs smoothly. If you have Insurance they will be happy to take you in. I did not deal in cash but cash processing is also smooth judging by the queue."

    "text": "Overcoming the surgery\nOne of the best things about this hospital is its rehabilitation unit. It is where the post-operative care happens, and this is not treated as an add-on; it is considered part of the treatment. All of the people I interacted with were very patient with patients. They would answer all your questions. My father was able to walk after 2 months of the surgery. I consider this to be a miracle of sorts. I think the hospital staff does a lot of things really well, but there is little being done to ensure transparency between departments. The doctors are transparent, but they do not always help the nursing staff explain their decisions. This leads to confusion for the attendants. The ICU times are perfect and do not need change. The hospital even gave me some slack for feeding my father without the nurse, which I am incredibly grateful for. Insurance paperwork is really a pain and there are 6 desks to visit. For an attendant, it may seem overwhelming. It is streamlined and people are really helpful, but from day 1, the paperwork seems like a lot. My only benchmark is Max Gurgaon near the Huda Metro Station where the paperwork is just a few signatures. But the positive is everyone tries to help. The staff in the Admissions office help you even if they are non-chalant"

I needed a lot of coffee.\nJunior doctors are your friends. Please listen to them\nGuards are better in the night than during the day\nHave good relations with the nurses, they do more paperwork in a day than what you do in a year. They will help you when you need it. Don’t ask for your test results from them because the doctor is supposed to inform you of that. If the doctors become of aware of this, nurses get a stick from the head nurse\nWhatever games you are thinking that the hospital is playing to increase your bills, it is not\nICU is Intensive Care Unit. Avoid touching anything and use copious amounts of hand sanitizer if you must touch something\nHDU is a High Dependency Unit. This is confusing to a lot of the patients. This means that the patient is out of danger but still needs active monitoring. The timings of visit are different from ICU. But rules are the same as the ICU. The doctor is there during visiting times to give you updates.\nDo not get nurses in trouble with the doctors\nFloor managers are there for assessing the arrangements. Please do not use them to get your way because they are the admin\nIf you are the sole attendant and there is no place to sleep, the best place is your car or near the emergency beside the Cafe Coffee Day. Do not go the attendant’s ward because that place is likely to be filled and is a den of mosquitos"

When I started, I believed that dedicating a decade to my profession would make me exceptionally skilled at it.\nIn my early career days, I naively thought five years would be sufficient to achieve meaningful accomplishments in data science. Looking back, I can only smile at my youthful optimism.\nThe reality is that I’ve rarely paused to critically evaluate my career trajectory. There’s a sense that I’ve simply drifted along the current. Despite making conscious efforts toward promotion, these attempts haven’t significantly impacted my professional growth so far.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT released their new image generation model, sparking excitement about Ghibli-style transformations and igniting a Twitter discourse. My thoughts:\n\nOn AI “stealing” artistic styles: As an Indian, I view digital rights and AI art debates through a unique lens. The concept feels somewhat abstract in my context.\nGlobal perspective: Most people engaging with these tools aren’t Ghibli aficionados - they’re following trends. Meanwhile, Ghibli gains worldwide exposure through these interactions.\nCorporate caution: Meta likely has similar technology in development but hesitates on release due to copyright concerns. They’re playing it safe while LLMs force us to reconsider intellectual property frameworks altogether.\nHumorous observation: Given India’s unique relationship with copyright (considering T-series and Pritam’s success), perhaps we could offer “Judiciary as a Service” to tech giants navigating digital rights challenges.\n\n\n\n\nGemini 2.5 appears to outperform Claude 3.7. It’s fascinating that Google maintains technical superiority yet struggles with market perception in AI. The best technology doesn’t always win the market.\nComparing ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok reveals ChatGPT’s strength lies primarily in marketing - an advantage that may fade without developing stronger B2B applications beyond their core model.\n\n\n\nSatya Nadella stands out for his exceptional clarity as a CEO. His conversation with Dwarkesh about AGI timeline assessment was remarkably thoughtful. Nadella suggests that true AGI would manifest as a 10% GDP increase within three years - indicating that economic benchmarks remain the truest measure of technological impact, and that current “intelligence as a service” hasn’t yet achieved substantial enterprise adoption.\n\n\n\n\nI’m interested in exploring Agents further, though I should first document HTML5 generation for model explainability.
